# PiTrain
Controlling a modeltrain layout using a Raspberry Pi 2.

A CAN module is used to control the model train (using PICAN board http://skpang.co.uk/catalog/pican-canbus-board-for-raspberry-pi-p-1196.html)

The train detection is done using a S88 module (http://www.ldt-infocenter.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:rm-88-n-o).

All programs are written in python 3.4.3 (Python 3.4.3 has support for CAN Sockets).

This is a work in progress.
